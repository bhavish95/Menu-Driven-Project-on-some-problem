# Menu-Driven-Project-on-some-problem
This is a mini project that helps users to find outthesolutionofproblems based on Armstrong function, Fibonacci number, quadratic equation, Floyd and pascal triangle, value sin(x), and cos(x). Here, you can simply put the value andcanfind your answer, it showswhether a number is Armstrong function or not, showsFibonacciseries, shows the solution of quadratic equation, makes Floyd and pascal triangle, shows the value of sin(x) and cos(x) functions. With this project, we can perform the basic problems that we do in our day-to-day life. The entire project is implemented using the C programming language. The source code of this project is around 150 lines and included in this report. The majority of the task is implemented using functions and files. Files are used for storing the user information and the tasks are implemented through functions.
